Animated Documentary 2024
---
This project is a retelling of a story my father often told me as a child, about how he got lost in the bush.
The goal of the animation is to completely immerse you in its setting through the use of animation techniques and audio design.
I aimed to create something that reminds the viewer of a time when they were told stories by their parentsâ€”something that takes them back to childhood and makes them feel cozy through warm lighting and soft ambient sound effects.
