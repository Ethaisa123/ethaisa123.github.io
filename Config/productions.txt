Corvus EX Machina - 3D Animator / 3D Environment Modeler
Auckland University of Technology
2025

Corvus EX Machina was my capstone project. My research question (and thus my role in the group) focused primarily on character animation. I learned a lot about teamwork, the importance of communication, and how to handle challenges when things go wrong. I’m very proud of the work I did on this project and feel that I’ve grown significantly as an animator through it.

UNFOUND - Solo Project
Auckland University of Technology
2024
https://portfolio-images-ethanvanwijk.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Poster.png
This was a solo animated documentary where we animated an interview we conducted ourselves. I handled every stage of the project - from storyboards and concept art to rendering and compositing. My main focus was on how to make limited animation look appealing in a realistic environment, which pushed me to explore and apply various limited animation techniques throughout the production.

This project was a group animation assessment about a creature. The assessment involved modeling and sculpting a creature from scratch, re-topologizing, rigging, and texturing the creature, and then animating it in a custom-built environment. This assessment also emphasized teamwork and communication, as we collaborated closely with other members of a group to bring the animation to life.
