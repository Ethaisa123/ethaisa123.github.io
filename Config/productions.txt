Corvix Ex Machina was my capstone project, my reaserch question (and thus my role in the group) was character animation first and foremost, I learned a lot about working in teams and the importance of communication and what to do when things go wrong, I am very proud of the work I did in this project and I feel that I have been able to grow as an animator through it.

This was a solo animated documentary where we animated an interview we took ourselves, I did the whole project from storyboards and concepts to rendering and compositing, my main focust was on how to make limited animation look good in a realistic environment and that pushed me to learn about limited animation techniques and how the could be applied to my project!
