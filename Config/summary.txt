As a soon-to-be graduate at Auckland University of Technology, I’m planning on becoming a 3D Character Animator.
I’m a photographer, I like repairing retro consoles, and I love all things tech - in fact, I’m hosting this very website on GitHub and my very own NAS!
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through any of the icons above. I’d love to chat about anything!
